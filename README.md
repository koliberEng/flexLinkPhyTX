# flexLink Physical Layer TX Models
This repo contains the code associated FlexLink RF waveform. This repository is a public respository that has physical layer model and supporting material. 

The FlexLink standard is an open physical layer, PHY specification of a packet based OFDM radio link used for applications where the transceiver stations may be in motion and/or stationary. The time division duplex, TDD, link will 
support point to point and point to multi-point communication. The specification is designed with the framework for a radio link that supports video transmission from fast moving terminals such as FPV drones. However, 
in general, the specification provides for both high reliability and high throughput transmissions between multiple terminals that are in motion or stationary. Whereas modem specifications, such as 3GPPâ€™s 5G New Radio or IEEE 802.11 WLAN, already exist for similar applications, they 
have certain drawbacks that FlexLink attempts to sidestep and simplify
